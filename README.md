# Carew Castle LED Cloner
## Introduction

Carew Castle boards are tiny 10mmx10mm boards that are designed to power big LED's, other boards (like Conwy Castles) or Vibration Motors with up to 2Amps of current. (way more than a what you find on an output of a Wemos D1 or Arduino!)
Additionally, it can be used to "clone" the flicker pattern of a small 3mm candle flickering LED to a larger 1 Watt LED (any color) or even to Flexileds.

Please take a minute to read through the uses - there's usability hints throughout that will inspire creative usage!

## Uses
Wiston Castle can be used over the surface of the table, within the base of a piece of scatter terrain piece or the case of a player character etc.
### Example 1 - Cloning a 3mm Candle LED to a 1Watt LED.

### Example 2 - Cloning a 3mm Candle to all outputs of a Conwy Castle
INSERT PICTURE
2 methods here: 
- One as a straight power switch
- Cloning the Candle to all 4 outputs. (flicker will be synchronous)

### Example 3 - Using an Arduino or a Wemos D1 to power a larger load (e.g. 1W LED, Conwy or Vibration Motor)
